# How can one make the Nintendo DS accept a secured connection?
This research paper aims to answer the question of "**How can one make the Nintendo DS accept a secured connection?**" by using the foundation laid down in the first research paper. In order to fully understand this topic, one must understand and know the security measures implemented in the Nintendo DS, as well as the flaws present. While a brief explanation on various topics of interest will be provided in this document, it is recommended to read through the provided source material for a more complete understanding of said topics.

## What prevents a Nintendo DS from making a secured connection?
When a Nintendo DS attempts to establish a secure connection, it will validate the certificate the server returns. In order for the Nintendo DS to accept the certificate as legitimate, it has to be signed by an intermediate certificate (and it's accompanying private key) that can be traced back to the Nintendo intermediate certificate via the chain of trust. As no authentic server certificate/private key combination is not publicly available, it is impossible to have a Nintendo DS accept a secured connection to a server other than Nintendo's official servers.

## What solutions are available?
In order to force the Nintendo DS to accept connections to these domains, two countermeasures have been created.

### Editing the executable of a game
The first solution involves altering the executable of a game. By altering all mentions of `https` to `http`, the Nintendo DS will attempt to connect to all servers using unsecured connections. Using this method means no security implementation is necessary on the server's end. This makes setting up a server significantly easier to do. It also allows for all domain names to be altered, allowing Nintendo DS systems to directly connect to a domain owned by the server owner without the need of an altered DNS list.

However, this method also comes with a few disadvantages. First, the game gets stripped of what little security was implemented, making it an even bigger security threat. Second, due to the nature of how Nintendo DS cartridges work, the data on them cannot be overwritten. This means that legitimate cartridges cannot connect to the server using this method. Finally, additional hardware is needed to play the altered game files. Said hardware is deemed illegal in most countries, and thus not easily obtainable, making this an investment.

#### Setup process
In order to set up this method, the user needs to have a dumped copy of a game that has online functionality, as well as a piece of software named WfcPatcher. This program has the ability to change the URL's in the game executable based on the user's input. If the user adds `NoSSL` to the filename of the game dump, then drags the file to the WfcPatcher executable, it will remove all mentions of `https` and replace them with `http`. This effectively forces the Nintendo DS to initiate unsecured connections and send unencrypted messages.

#### Production example
The image below shows a network capture of a Nintendo DS connecting to `nas.nintendowifi.net` without any modifications. As shown, the Nintendo DS and the server perform the handshake prodecure before exchanging encrypted messages with one another.

The image below uses the same situation as before. The difference being that the game has been altered as to not use secured connections. Instead of initiating the handshake procedure, the game instead opens up an unsecured TCP connection. As shown, the message the Nintendo DS sends to the server is in plain text.

### Abusing a flaw in the certificate validation process.
The second solution involves abusing a flaw in the Nintendo DS certificate verification process. When the Nintendo DS verifies the server certificate, it attempts to follow the chain of trust back to the Nintendo intermediate certificate. However, it does not verify if all of the certificates in the chain are allowed to act as an intermediate. This means that any certificate/private pair that can be traced back to the Nintendo intermediate certificate can be used to generate a server certificate that the Nintendo DS will accept. This method would mean no modifications are necessary on the client side for this method to work. This also means legitimate cartridges will be able to connect to the server using this method.

This method too comes with a few disadvantages. First, this method would require the server owner to set up a custom DNS list, as the requested domain names do not exist anymore. Second, this method requires a certificate/private key pair that can be used to generate a server certificate. Finally, knowledge on how to generate a server certificate and implement it in a server is necessary to get the server running, which might be difficult due to the lacking documentation on the topic.

#### Certificate generation process
The following process is a recollection of steps I went through to generate a server certificate the Nintendo DS will accept. The following will be assumed:
- The reader is in possession of a working OpenSSL installation.
- The reader is in posession certificate/private key pair that can be traced back to Nintendo's intermediate certificate. This may be combined in `p12` format or split in `.csr` format for the certificate and `.key` format for the private key.
- The target machine runs a copy of Windows. Some parts might differ with other operating systems.

Furthermore, the certificate/private key combination will be referred to as `NWC.p12` from here on out.


**1.** If the certificate/private key pair has already been separated in `.csr` and `.key` files, start at step 4. If not, it first needs to be split. To do so, use the following command:

`openssl pkcs12 -in NWC.p12 -passin alpine -passout alpine -out keys.txt`

**2.** If the command completed successfully, a keys.txt file should have been created the folder where the `NWC.p12` file is located. Open this file in a text editor, and create a new file in a hex editor (HxD is recommended). Select everything from the start of the first line to the end of the first `----CERTIFICATE END----` line (including the blank line underneath), copy it and paste it in the text segment of the new file in the hex editor. Finally, Save this file as `NWC.crt`.

**3.** Create another new file in the hex editor and perform the same actions as with the `NWC.crt` file, but use everything underneath the previously selected segment instead. Save this file as `NWC.key`

**4.** Once `NWC.csr` and `NWC.key` have been created, they can be used to generate a new server certificate. To start this process, use the following command to generate a 1024-bit RSA key for the new certificate:

`openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024`

- If the command has finished running successfully, a new file named `server.key` should have appeared in the same directory as the `NWC.p12` file. If it has, use the following command to generate a new certificate using the `server.key` file generated in the previous step:

`openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr`

During this process, a series of questions regarding the organization the certificate belongs to will be asked. The table underneath shows the values used by the official server certificate (and the certificate I generated), but can be customized if desired.
| Question                 | Answer                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Country Name             | US                                                     |
| State or Province        | Washington                                             |
| Locality name            |                                                        |
| Organization name        | Nintendo of America Inc.                               |
| Organizational unit name | Nintendo CA                                            |
| Common name              | Domain name or `*.*.*` for all subdomains              |
| Email address            | ca@noa.nintendo.com                                    |
| Challenge password       | Can be anything (`alpine` recommended for consistency) |
| Optional company name    |                                                        |

**5.** If the command has finished successfully, a new file named `server.csr` should have appeared in the same directory as the `NWC.p12` file. This is the new server certificate that will be used by the server to authenticate with the Nintendo DS. Before it can be used, it first needs to be signed by the `NWC.csr` certificate file and `NWC.key` key file. To do so, use the following command:

`openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA NWC.crt -CAkey NWC.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 3650 -sha1`

This certificate will be valid for 3650 days, or 10 years. This value may be changed to suit the needs of your server

**6.** Once the newly created server certificate has been signed, the certificate and private key pair can be combined into one file for installation in the certificate store. To do so, use the following command to combine the two into a .pfx file:

`openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey server.key -in server.crt -out server.pfx`

When prompted to use an export password, anything can be used. However, `alpine` is recommended for consistency.

**7.** If the command has finished successfully, a new file named `server.pfx` should have appeared in the same directory as the `NWC.p12` file. In order to install both certificates to the certificate store, double-click on both the `NWC.p12` and `server.pfx` files and going through the installation wizard for both. When asked for an export password, use `alpine` for the `NWC.p12` certificate and the password entered during the previous step for the `server.pfx` certificate. When asked to select the certificate store, select `Place all certificates in the following store` and select the `Personal` store. Once this has been done, the certificates are ready for use in whichever environment the user requires them.

#### Production example
Underneath is a code snippet containing a simple TCP listener with SSL authentication and certificate search functionality. The program starts by setting up the TCP listener and searching for the required certificates. This is done by providing the names of those who the certificate was issued to (`*.*.*` for the server certificate, `Wii NWC Prod 1` for the intermediate certificate). After a successfull setup, the program starts listening for incoming connections.

Once a pending connection request has been detected, the server accepts the connection before retrieving the data stream and authenticating with the client. As noted earlier in this document, the server uses SSLv3 as the cryptographic protocol and provides the client with both the server certificate and the certificate chain. By providing both the server certificate and certificate chain, the Nintendo DS will be able to follow the chain of trust back to the Nintendo intermediate certificate and accept the connection.

### Conclusion
Despite the lack of an official server certificate/private key combination, there are methods to circumvent (or completely negate) the SSL security implemented in the Nintendo DS. While both methods have both advantages and disadvantages, the lack of need for any additional hardware makes the second method inherently more favourable. While this method has a particularly steep learning curve due to the lack of any documentation on the topic, once implemented, it requires no additional modifications on the user's side.
